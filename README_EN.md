## üìú About This Project

**Revolution Multiplayer** was born out of frustration with the SA-MP ecosystem dominated by private, paywalled scripts.  
This project is both an answer and a movement: proof that the community can collaborate to create a high-quality gamemode accessible to everyone, free of charge.

We‚Äôre building the gamemode foundation from scratch using a modern technology stack to ensure that this project is easy to maintain, extend, and run by anyone.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Spinning up your development server is simple thanks to Docker.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/revolutionmp/revolution.git
    cd revolution
    ```

2.  **Create the environment configuration file:**
    Copy the example `.env.example` into `.env`. This file stores your sensitive configurations.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Edit `.env`:**
    Open `.env` and fill in the required values, especially the database password.

4.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    This command will build the image, download the database, and launch everything automatically.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

Your server should now be running! You can view the logs with:
```bash
docker compose logs -f samp
```
